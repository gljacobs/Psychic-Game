# Psychic-Game
* This app is a guessing game. The computer chooses a letter at random and the user has 9 attempts to guess which letter the computer has chosen. The app logs wins/losses and chooses a new letter for the user to guess after all 9 attempts have been used (loss) or after the user guesses the correct letter (win).
